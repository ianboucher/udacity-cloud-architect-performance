Rationale,,,,,,,,
"Given a doubling of the infrastructure budget with the aim of increasing performance and reliability, rearchitecting to use an active-active multi-region configuration seems like a good choice. Assuming the entire user-base is distributed throughout the US, the addition of a 2nd region in us-west-2 would potentially reduce latency for a large number of users, whilst also significantly increasing the resiliancy of the app, in the event of single-region outages. RDS Aurora Serverless was chosen for persistence due to its improved support for distributed data and replication across regions, whilst also reducing operational overhead. Latency checks were added to Route53 so that client requests can be routed to the region that will provide the fastest response to the user.",,,,,,,,
